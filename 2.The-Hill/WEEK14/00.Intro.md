# Intro to week 13

---

Heeellooooow world !!!

Hope you had a good weekend ! :)

We're getting closer to have a nice and beautiful fullstack application !

Thinking of an app, we saw until now :

- Frontend

  - HTML structure
  - Styling with CSS
  - Javascript for frontend interactions

- Backend
  - Programming a server to listen for requests
  - Handling routes
  - Communicating with a database
  - Communicating with the front through an API

For a complete basic app, there is one thing missing : Authentication !

Of course, an app can require a huge amount of logic in the server regarding so many different things and functionnalities (the sky is the limit !)

But all basic apps have these bullet points :

- A nice frontend (beautiful and dynamic)
- Connection with a database
- API to connect with the front
- Authentication in order to register, login, logout users.

With this, you can tackle so many wonderful projects !

Well... it's time, my friends !

Let's learn the last missing piece of this puzzle !

**AUTHENTICATION !!!**

This week, we are going to learn how to authenticate users and then we'll start our big fullstack project in groups.

So... Let's move on, shall we ?
