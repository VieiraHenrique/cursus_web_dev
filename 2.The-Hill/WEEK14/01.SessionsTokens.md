# Sessions VS Tokens

---

There are traditionnaly two main ways of authenticate users on the web : `sessions` and `tokens`.

---

Imagine you're entering a secret club with a special membership card. In this analogy, the club represents a website or application, and the membership card represents your authentication.

**Session-based authentication** is like having a temporary pass that allows you to enter the club for a specific period.

When you log in, the club gives you a unique pass that identifies you and lets you access the club's facilities.

This pass is stored in your pocket (`like a cookie in your browser`) and is presented to the club guard (the website server) with each request you make. The guard checks your pass and lets you in **_if it's still valid_**. (it looks into the database if this session exists)

**Token-based authentication** is like having a permanent membership card that allows you to enter the club whenever you want. When you join the club, you receive a personalized membership card with your details encoded on it. You keep this card in your wallet (`like a token in your local storage or memory`), and whenever you want to enter the club, you simply show the card to the guard. The guard scans the card and verifies your membership status.

Not so clear ? I tried my best... :/

Go look for what `cookies`, `sessions` and `tokens` are and how they can help us verify if someone is an user, have access, etc.

Want some videos ?

Have a look to [this](https://youtu.be/UBUNrFtufWo?si=TWfJHQIxIC2ypSRB) video.

And, for more, at [this](https://youtu.be/hoBSjmrwF1k?si=27cD9qi7e8hOmC2G) one.

Longer one : [video](https://youtu.be/7Q17ubqLfaM?si=R0-mZwRBNoZ0dU8x)

But the best video I found is [this](https://youtu.be/2PPSXonhIck?si=B3YEOxSwICnn-6QE) one. It's longer (40min) but very clear and complete.

Authentication is not an easy matter. You'll have to stick to it to really understand how it works. Good luck young padawans !

Want a full and wonderful video about how to implement JWT in a Node/Express app ? [here](https://youtu.be/b9WlsQMGWMQ?si=QIFL1o0Wi7xY8i1N)

But... hey... You know what's coming next, don't you ? **NET NINJA!!!**

This [series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iqqESP8335DA5cRFp8loyp&si=B61WvtLnKiL5r71r) is all you need in order to implement a proper api with JWT authentication.
